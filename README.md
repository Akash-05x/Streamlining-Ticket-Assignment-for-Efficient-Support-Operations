README: Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations
This README provides an overview and summary of the project documents related to the development and testing of the project titled 'Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations'. This project aims to automate and optimize ticket distribution to improve response time and customer satisfaction.
📘 Project Overview
The project focuses on automating the assignment of support tickets using rule-based logic. It ensures tickets are distributed evenly among agents based on workload, skill, and priority. The automation reduces manual intervention, speeds up response times, and enhances transparency.
📂 Documents Summary
1. Empathy Map Canvas
Captures user behaviors, attitudes, and challenges in managing support tickets. It helps understand end-user needs and define better system solutions.
2. Define Problem Statements Template
Defines the customer problem statement highlighting inefficiencies in manual ticket management, such as delayed response times and uneven workload distribution.
3. Brainstorming & Idea Prioritization Template
Documents the ideation phase, where team members collaborated to identify, group, and prioritize solutions. The top idea chosen was automating ticket assignment to improve operational efficiency.
4. Problem–Solution Fit Template
Explains how the proposed solution addresses core inefficiencies. It connects automation, faster response times, and improved customer satisfaction.
5. Proposed Solution
Outlines the technical and business aspects of the project. It describes a rule-based automation system that assigns tickets according to agent skill, workload, and priority. The section also emphasizes social impact and scalability.
6. Solution Architecture
Provides the architectural design of the system, including ticket and agent tables, rule engine logic, and automation flow. It describes data flow and how different modules integrate for efficient ticket routing.
7. Project Planning
Includes Agile-based sprint planning, story points, backlog, and sprint tracking. The project is divided into four sprints covering user management, role management, ACL creation, flow automation, and testing.
8. Performance Testing
Summarizes the testing results for each component: user creation, group and role setup, table configuration, access control, and automation flow. The model achieved an overall success rate of 98% and a confidence score of 95%.
